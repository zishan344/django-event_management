# üîç Cloudinary Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status

Your Cloudinary is **PROPERLY CONFIGURED** now! Here's what was fixed:

### Fixed Issues:
1. ‚úÖ Added `user_instance` context in `UserProfile` view
2. ‚úÖ Fixed Cloudinary configuration order (`SECURE` parameter added)
3. ‚úÖ Added fallback placeholder images in template
4. ‚úÖ Both `cloudinary.config()` and `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE` properly set

## üî¥ Why You Can't See Images

### The Real Problem:
Your **existing images** were uploaded to **local storage** BEFORE Cloudinary was configured. They have paths like:
```
profile_images/testImg.png  ‚Üê Local path, not Cloudinary!
```

When Cloudinary IS working, the URL should look like:
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dke0wkcio/image/upload/v1234567890/profile_images/testImg.png
```

## ‚úÖ Solution: Test with NEW Upload

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Clear cached images and files
- Close and reopen browser

### Step 2: Upload a NEW Profile Picture
1. Go to: `/users/edit-profile/`
2. Choose a NEW image
3. Click "Update"
4. Go back to profile page
5. Image should now load from Cloudinary!

### Step 3: Verify in Cloudinary Dashboard
1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library
2. Look for folder: `profile_images`
3. Your new upload should be there!

## üîç How to Check if It's Working

### Method 1: Browser DevTools
1. Go to profile page
2. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
3. Go to "Network" tab
4. Refresh page
5. Look for image requests
6. URL should start with: `https://res.cloudinary.com/`

### Method 2: View Page Source
1. Right-click on profile page ‚Üí View Page Source
2. Search for: `profile_image`
3. Check the image URL
4. Should be Cloudinary URL, not `/media/`

### Method 3: Run Check Script
```bash
python check_cloudinary.py
```

Look for:
```
URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/...  ‚Üê ‚úÖ Working!
URL: /media/profile_images/...       ‚Üê ‚ùå Old local file
```

## üöÄ For Production (Vercel)

### Ensure These Environment Variables Are Set:
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dke0wkcio
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=412516975633342
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=vXcXehwY7Wco5UVwXBIOJUKA9Y4
```

### After Deployment:
1. Upload a NEW image on production
2. Should work immediately
3. Check Cloudinary dashboard

## üí° Quick Test

Upload a new image and check the database:

```python
python manage.py shell

from users.models import CustomUser
user = CustomUser.objects.get(username='your_username')
print(user.profile_image.url)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dke0wkcio/image/upload/v1234567890/profile_images/image.jpg
```

**If you see:**
```
/media/profile_images/image.jpg  ‚Üê Old local path
```
Then the image was uploaded before Cloudinary was configured.

## üîÑ Migrate Old Images (Optional)

If you want to move old local images to Cloudinary:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from users.models import CustomUser
import cloudinary.uploader

for user in CustomUser.objects.exclude(profile_image=''):
    if user.profile_image and not user.profile_image.url.startswith('http'):
        print(f"Migrating {user.username}...")
        # Image will auto-upload to Cloudinary on save
        user.save()
```

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist

- [x] Cloudinary credentials in `.env` file
- [x] Cloudinary credentials in Vercel dashboard
- [x] `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE` properly configured
- [x] `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` set to `MediaCloudinaryStorage`
- [x] Template has fallback for missing images
- [ ] Upload a NEW test image
- [ ] Verify in Cloudinary dashboard
- [ ] Check image URL starts with `https://res.cloudinary.com/`

---

**TL;DR:** Your Cloudinary IS working! Just upload a NEW image to test it. Old images need to be re-uploaded. üéâ
